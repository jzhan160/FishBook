FishBook is a website that aims to provide a new community for fishermen. People can explore fishing spots here and post their fishing experiences. You can sign up an account for logining in or look for fishing places on the map page without sign-in. After registration, you can create your own profile showing your information and previous posts to others. Users can post their fishing activities with text and pictures. People nearby can see your new activites, interact with commments share your posts, or mark your posts as favorite. Users can also follow each other to build a friend circle and you can see people you are following and who are following you on the following and follower pages. Moreover, we integrate the Google Map API to deal with functions about locations. People can overview all posts marked on the map. By clicking one spot, they can see the post information in that place. Our website also support to select a position on the map as your posting spot and start a new post. The notification system will inform you if there are new messages or related comments.
